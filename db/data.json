         "p5":"The endocarp is the innermost boundary around the seed. Sometimes the endocarp is hard and stony such as a peach pit that surrounds the seed. The endocarp can also be papery as in apples, where it is barely visible in cross-section. All three of these regions; the exocarp, mesocarp, and endocarp, are collectively called the pericarp. The pericarp can be quite thin, as is the case with dry fruits."

Pectin is also fermented by beneficial bacteria in the colon, which produces short chain fatty acids that may play a role in the prevention of chronic diseases, including certain cancers and bowel disorders"

         "p5":"In ancient Chinese medical practices, lychee seed was always used for hernia, orchitis, ulcers, and intestinal troubles. Diabetes-related symptoms were known as “Xiaoke” (emaciation and thirst) in the ancient Chinese medical literature (Tong et al., 2012). In Compendium of Materia Medica (Ben Cao Gang Mu) written by Li Shizhen (from 1518 to 1593 AD) during the Ming dynasty, the lychee seed was warm in nature, sweet in taste, and could act as a beneficial agent in thirst-quenching. Numerous Chinese patent medicines such as Jinlida granule (Tian et al., 2018) and Jiangtangtongmai tablets (Su et al., 2017) approved by the Chinese Food and Drug Administration, containing lychee seed, were clinically used for the treatment of diabetes."
